   <h1>Pasta Fazool</h1> 
   <img src="../images/pasta.jpg" alt="Picture of Pasta Fazool">
   <p>Pasta fazool is classic Italian American comfort food. This recipe works with any sausage, but I like the fennel and anise flavors of sweet Italian sausage with the beans.</p> 
   <p>A hearty soup that's fast and easy to put together.</p>
